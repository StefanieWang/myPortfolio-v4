# myPortfolio-v4

This is the 4th version of my portofolio (hopefully will be the last one~). I designed and built it from scratch. 

1. It is build mainly with HTML5 and CSS3 with a little bit of JavaScript & jQuery, ensuring that features gracefully degrade.

2. It is designed fully responsively with the CSS3 Flexbox layout.

3. It has 3 main sections ( About, Projects and Contact), and has a nav bar linked to them. 
   The Projects section has a showcase section and a project list section which will be hidden on small devices ( can be shown by clicking
   the "View More" button).
   
Things to do: the descriptions(now shown as lists) of showcase projects are not elegant enough, I will try to make the descriptions more abstract
and will consider move the project description into a modal window. In addtion, I will add my photo at a proper place in the About section 
(not pretty enough to take a photo recently).

I will continue refine the design until I am fully satisfied.
